# Security Recommendations for Kiro IDE + Strands SDK Workshop

## Overview

This document provides security recommendations for instructors and participants in the Kiro IDE + Strands SDK workshop. Following these guidelines will help ensure a secure learning environment and promote good security practices in AI agent development.

## For Workshop Instructors

### Environment Setup

1. **Secure Script Execution**
   - Avoid using `shell=True` in subprocess calls
   - Use lists of arguments instead of strings
   - Validate all user inputs before using in commands
   - Use the principle of least privilege for executed commands

2. **File Operations Security**
   - Validate and sanitize all file paths
   - Use absolute paths with proper validation
   - Restrict file operations to specific directories
   - Set proper file permissions (0600 for sensitive files)

3. **Credential Management**
   - Never include actual credentials in setup scripts or templates
   - Create template files with clear warnings about credential security
   - Provide instructions for secure credential management
   - Recommend using environment variables or secrets managers

4. **Workshop Materials**
   - Include security best practices in all code examples
   - Highlight security considerations in documentation
   - Provide a security checklist for participants
   - Include security testing in workshop exercises

### Workshop Delivery

1. **Security Awareness**
   - Begin each session with security reminders
   - Highlight security implications of each topic
   - Demonstrate secure vs. insecure implementations
   - Encourage questions about security considerations

2. **Code Reviews**
   - Include security criteria in code reviews
   - Provide feedback on security issues
   - Recognize good security practices
   - Share real-world security incident examples

## For Workshop Participants

### Environment Setup

1. **AWS Credentials**
   - Use AWS CLI's `aws configure` command for credential setup
   - Set proper permissions on credential files (0600)
   - Use IAM roles with minimal permissions
   - Never commit credentials to version control

2. **GitHub Tokens**
   - Create tokens with minimal required permissions
   - Store tokens in environment variables
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Revoke tokens after the workshop if no longer needed

3. **Local Environment**
   - Keep software updated with security patches
   - Use virtual environments for Python dependencies
   - Verify downloads with checksums when available
   - Follow principle of least privilege for all tools

### Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for databases
   - Avoid dangerous functions like `eval()` and `exec()`
   - Implement proper input sanitization

2. **Error Handling**
   - Log detailed errors for developers
   - Show generic error messages to users
   - Handle different error types appropriately
   - Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages

3. **File Operations**
   - Validate file paths to prevent path traversal
   - Use secure file permissions
   - Sanitize file names and content
   - Implement proper error handling for file operations

4. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all network communications
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Implement proper timeout settings
   - Validate server certificates
